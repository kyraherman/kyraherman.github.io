        <p>Nashville is known as the heart of Tennessee. From a pilots perspective the the city itself is 36.17 latitude and -86.78 longitude. 
    While the Appalachian mountains are close by, the elevation of Nashville is about 171 meters above the sea level. Nashville is included in the central daylight time zone. 
    </p> <p>The bank of the Cumberland River was the original site of the city and still exists today. While the city seems busy, outskirts and surrounding area consists of farmland. 
    This farmland supports much of the economy in the state. Nashville can be full of traffic right downtown but walking the streets is highly encouraged. 
    It is also very wise to check out a map of the downtown area before hand, or planning your routes so you can see as much as possible.</p>
