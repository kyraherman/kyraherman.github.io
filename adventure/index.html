        <p style="font-family: Arial;"> The car is packed and ready to go. There was a checklist of a few key items that I couldn't forget. It looked a little something like this: Camera, Sunglasses, Wallet, Walking Shoes, and my friend (of course). Madison Wisconsin is navigated into Google Maps and we couldn't be more excited to roam the city. After some research a list of top 10 places to see was created. We decided that a stop has to be made at the top 5 places.
<!-- These are must have items, don't leave your house without them! -->
<ul style="list-style-type: square; font-family: Arial;"> <i> Items to Remember </i>
    <li> Camera </li>

        <p style="font-family: Arial;"> Today we drove into Madison Wisconsin right down East Washington Avenue. I could see the top of the capitaol a few miles before reaching the downtown. It was beautiful! The first adventure of the day was visiting the <strong> Monona Terrace </strong>. Thankfully I brought a nice quality <em> camera </em> along because the terrace chairs were so vibrant, colorful, very unique. On top of all the exciting new attractions, the weather made it a perfect day. Unfortunately, I forgot <em> sunglasses </em>, so if you plan on strolling Madtown (the nickname college students give their city) for the day, remember a pair of shades.

<h1 id="Entry3" style="background-color:Tomato;font-family:Arial; text-align: center;"> Stroll Down the Street </h1>
    <img src="http://pics4.city-data.com/cpicc/cfiles88592.jpg" alt="State Street" </img>
    <h2 style="background-color: LightGray;font-family: Arial;"> August 17 2019 </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">I found out today that Wisconsin has really good <em> cheese curds </em>. My friend and I discovered these delicious curds (as the people of Madison like to call them) while walking state street. State street is exactly as in the name, a street. The cool thing is there is not much traffic that goes through the street. Lining the street is stores, restaurants, and ice cream shops, &#38 museums . On one end you see the lake and the other the capitol. Itâ€™s a must if you travel to Madison.

    <!-- These words should sound familiar if you hear them in Madison. -->
    <ul style="font-family:Arial;"><i> Madison Slang </i>
        <li> Madtown - name of the city according to university students. </li>
            <li> Curds - Wisconsin's famous Cheese Curds. </li>
                <li> Varsity - Alma Mater for all Badgrs sung at special events. </li>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">We went to a Badger football game today! Watching the whole statium sway to <strong> Varsity </strong> together was special. Varsity is the alma mater for the Wisconsin Badgers and it is sung after any event or game. I also loved seeing all the college students dressed in the red and white striped overalls. School spirit is phenomanal. The city itself felt alive. Streets were filled and there didn't seem to be any parking avaliable for miles. After the game we found more , <strong> curds</strong> and thank goodness we had our <em> walking shoes </em> on. We then walked what seemed like miles to the Capitol building. The landcaping and structure was cool to see.
